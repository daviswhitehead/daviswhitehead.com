# Writing about products, life, and more

I write thoughts and ideas loosely related to living a well-lived life. Some posts are product pitches or critiques, others are about experiments in living, and some are deeply personal. My goals in writing are to build an engaged community to create products for, to think critically, and to live transparently. I'd love to hear your feedback.

Prompt: a digital book library where the books are inside of a medium-sized touch screen mounted on a wall inside a living room

I prefer digital books to analog. A digital book collection means you have your entire library in your pocket, saving physical space in your home. However, a digital library is invisible compared to an analog one. The visibility of an analog library is where analog beats digital.

I panic when it's time to buy eggs. The egg section of a grocery store has so too many options. The combination of brands, prices, sizes, colors, animal-welfare descriptors, etc ensure that I will never make a purchase decision aligned with my values. Is cage-free worth the extra $2?? I don't know :/.

What should we have for dinner tonight? The question posed in billions of households per day. As my family's chef de cuisine, I'm usually responsible for answering this question. That's easier said than done when you've cooked the same thing the last three weeks and you're not feeling inspired.

## Digital books are superior to analog in all but one way

I love reading. I only read books digitally and will go out of my way to replace analog books with digital copies. I prefer the experience of reading a book digitally to analog. It’s easy to lookup words, make annotations, and search through my notes. A digital book collection also means you have your entire library in your pocket saving physical space in your home. However, a digital library is invisible compared to an analog one. The visibility of an analog library is where analog beats digital. Let’s break down why this is true and why it’s important.
