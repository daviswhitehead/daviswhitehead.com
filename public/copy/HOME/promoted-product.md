## WHOOP

### WHOOP is an advanced fitness and health wearable. It monitors your recovery, sleep, training, and health, with personalized recommendations and coaching feedback.

Image

At WHOOP, I was the product lead for Member Experience, Sleep, Recovery, and Coaching Infrastucture. I led teams building new mobile app features, platform infrastructure, and internal tooling. I'm most proud of the impact I had on leveling up our Sleep Coaching value proposition. We helped users get deeper coaching on their sleep by overhauling the previous Sleep Details screen and providing a rotating personalized reason to checkout their sleep on WHOOP.

## Shayr

### Shayr makes it easy to discover, and give recommendations for, great content within your network of close friends.

Image

I created Shayr to promote more meaningful interactions between a user and their friends by increasing the likelihood that each person follows through on content recommendations. For example, you could use Shayr to recommend a specific podcast episode to me. And I could use Shayr to keep track, then let you know when I've listened. We can discuss our reactions within Shayr via commenting or have a great real-life discussion next time we meet.

## EverDrive

### EverDrive is a consumer mobile app to help people become safer drivers and reward safe driving with discounts on auto insurance.

Image

As the product lead for EverDrive for two years, I developed a long term vision and strategy for the product and launched many releases along the way. We improved the coaching users received on their safe driving by visualizing where unsafe driving events were most likely to occur. We also launched the first insurer-agnostic marketplace for safe driving discounts on auto insurance within the app to reward users for their safe driving.
