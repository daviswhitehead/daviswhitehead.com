### Intro
I'm a Product Manager at [WHOOP](https://whoop.com) on the Member Experience Infrastructure team. Our team's charter is to find ways to increase customer retention by leveraging our customer support team. Our work ranges from experimenting with new customer support related value propositions to building infrastructure that improves the customer support experience overall.
<br><br>

I've now been involved in the Boston startup scene for over six years.
- I started as a Quantitative Analyst for a local startup incubator called [Cogo Labs](https://www.cogolabs.com/). At [Cogo](https://www.cogolabs.com/), I learned how to apply data-driven insights to scale business functions including, marketing, product, and revenue.
- I later joined [EverQuote](https://everquote.com), a [Cogo](https://www.cogolabs.com/)-incubated insurance startup, as the Product Manager for [EverDrive](https://www.everquote.com/everdrive/) -- a consumer mobile app helping people become safer drivers and rewarding safe driving with discounts on auto insurance. As my first true product role, working on [EverDrive](https://www.everquote.com/everdrive/) was a crash course in Product Management. I came away with a solid foundation of product skills and a hunger to learn more. 
- While still at [EverQuote](https://everquote.com), I started building another consumer mobile app on the side called [Shayr](https://shayr.app). The project originated as an exercise to help me build empathy, understanding, and appreciation for the work our engineers were doing on [EverDrive](https://www.everquote.com/everdrive/). It quickly turned into a passion project and eventually a full-time role where I gained first-hand experience building a real product from zero to one.

### Current Focus
Since joining WHOOP in January of 2020, my focus has been to become a superb Product Manager. To me, that means building products that deliver substantial value to our customers and business, developing trusting and collaborative relationships with stakeholders, and galvanizing our team to pursue audacious goals.
<br><br>

Occasionally, I get distracted by new product concepts and experiment with them as a side project.
<br><br>

### History

I grew up in Atlanta and went to [Paideia](https://www.paideiaschool.org/) for grades K-12. I then went to [Middlebury College](https://www.middlebury.edu/) where I majored in Economics and minored in Chinese and Political Science. While at Midd, I also competed nationally in ultimate frisbee and made lifelong friendships. After college, I started my career working at [Epic](https://www.epic.com/) but then moved back to the northeast after a year to enter the Boston startup scene and reconvene with friends from Midd.
