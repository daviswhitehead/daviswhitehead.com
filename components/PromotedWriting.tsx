          I write thoughts and ideas loosely related to living a well-lived
          life. Some posts are product pitches or critiques, others are about
          experiments in living, and some are deeply personal. My goals in
          writing are to build an engaged community to create products for, to
          think critically, and to live transparently. Iâ€™d love to hear your
          feedback.
