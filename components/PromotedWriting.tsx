        I write reflections on what it means to live a well-lived life. Some
        posts are product pitches, others are about experiments in living, and
        some are deeply personal. My goals in writing are to build an engaged
        community to create products for, to think critically, and to live
        transparently. Iâ€™d love to hear your feedback.
